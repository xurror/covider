Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. However, the first case may be traced back to 17 November, 2019. As of 28 May 2020, more than 5.8 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 359,000 deaths. More than 2.39 million people have recovered. With the advent of this new killer disease, governments and international organisations and bodies have decided to take certain preventive measures to limit the widespread of the this virus, notably though worldwide confinements and providing certain basic necessities to populations in order to assist them in these tough times.

## Webapp

This contains both the Backend API and Web UI. The project follows an API based development for better integration.

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine: 
Node.js: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project. Depending on your system, you can install Node
either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle. 
After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools. You will only need to run this
command when dependencies change in package.json. 
- `cd webapp`
- `npm install`

Run the following commands in another two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser auto
refreshes when files change on your hard drive. 
- `./gradlew bootrun`
- `npm start`
